COSC 3380 Operating Systems Programming Assignment 1 (Multithreading)

For this assignment, you will create a multithreaded program using the Shannon coding data compression algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_coding).

Given an input string representing the message to encode using the Shannon coding technique (the input string can have any symbol from the ASCII alphabet):

AAABAAABAAAAMMAAAAAU

The expected output is:

Message: AAABAAABAAAAMMAAAAAU

Alphabet: Symbol: A, Frequency: 15, Shannon code: 0 Symbol: M, Frequency: 2, Shannon code: 1100 Symbol: B, Frequency: 2, Shannon code: 1101 Symbol: U, Frequency: 1, Shannon code: 11110

Encoded message: 000110100011010000110011000000011110

Process:

Your solution must execute the following steps:

Read the n lines from STDIN, where each line has an input string to encode using the Shannon coding algorithm. Create n POSIX threads (where n is the number of input strings). Each child thread executes the following tasks:

    Receives the input string used to encode the values.
    Creates the alphabet based on the received input string.
    Sorts the alphabet in decreasing order based on the symbols' frequency. If two or more symbols have the same frequency, you must sort them in decreasing order based on their ASCII value.
    Determines the Shannon codes for the symbols in the alphabet.
    Generates the encoded message by using the Shannon codes.
    Stores the alphabet (with the Shannon codes) and the encoded message on a memory location accessible by the main thread.

Print the information from the child threads into STDOUT.

Given the following input:

COSC 3360 COSC 1437 COSC 1336 COSC 2436 COSC 3320 COSC 3380

The expected output is:

COSC 3360 Operating Systems Assignment 2 (Client-Server Architecture)

Let's start with int main():

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int sockfd, portno, n;
  std::string buffer;
  struct sockaddr_in serv_addr;
  struct hostent *server;

If you‚Äôve taken Data Structures here at the University of Houston, argc and argv might look familiar to you. The integer argc is short for argument counter. When you run the code using ./main, you typically use 1 argument (./main), but for both server and client, you will be using multiple arguments. The character array pointer argv is short for argument variables, and keeps track of what the arguments you passed in actually say.

Now we move forward to initializing variables. sockfd is the socket file descriptor, and portno is the port number. N is not needed, but it serves the same purpose as pid in forking. The string buffer is the string we will send to and from the server. The final two structs are the server address and server, which we will use to initiate the socket connection between client and server. These are provided by the libraries, and do not need to be initialized to work.

    if (argc != 3) 
    {
       std::cerr << "usage " << argv[0] << " hostname port" << std::endl;
       exit(0);
    }
    portno = atoi(argv[2]);
    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd < 0) 
    {
        std::cerr << "ERROR opening socket" << std::endl;
        exit(0);
    }
    server = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
    if (server == NULL) {
        std::cerr << "ERROR, no such host" << std::endl;
        exit(0);
    }

When we run the client, we will have 3 total arguments. ./client is our first argument. The second argument depends on whether or not you are connecting to someone else‚Äôs device or your own. For your own device (which should be like 99.9% of the time for this assignment), it will be localhost. Keep in mind you must run the server first. For any other device, find out the device‚Äôs IP address (or something like that, not really sure) and use that as your argument. The third argument is the port number, which will be whatever you chose to initialize as when you ran the server, since it will be defined in the server‚Äôs run command.

We initialize the portno variable as the port number (the third argument, since argv, like all other indice-based data structures in C++, begin counting from 0), and initialize the socket file description sockfd as a socket with parameters AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, and 0. AF_INET is an IPV4 socket, and SOCK_STREAM is a TCP socket. 0 is the domain, which in most cases you should leave at 0, because 0 lets it automatically determine. None of this code is important for you to remember or understand (i think) but it‚Äôs good to have an idea of what‚Äôs going on just in case. The rest of the code is just error handling, nothing crazy.

    bzero((char *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
    serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    bcopy((char *)server->h_addr, 
         (char *)&serv_addr.sin_addr.s_addr,
         server->h_length);
    serv_addr.sin_port = htons(portno);
    if (connect(sockfd,(struct sockaddr *)&serv_addr,sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) 
    {
        std::cerr << "ERROR connecting" << std::endl;
        exit(0);
    }

The bzero function initializes an array as all 0s, and bcopy copies the values of an array to another, to remove any residual data. I‚Äôm not sure what the sin_ in, sin_family, and sin_port mean but they‚Äôre just initializing stuff. Then we call connect which actually initializes the connection from the client to the server.

std::cout << "Please enter the message: ";
    std::getline(std::cin,buffer);
    int msgSize = sizeof(buffer);
    n = write(sockfd,&msgSize,sizeof(int));
    if (n < 0) 
    {
        std::cerr << "ERROR writing to socket" << std::endl;
        exit(0);
    }
    n = write(sockfd,buffer.c_str(),msgSize);
    if (n < 0) 
    {
        std::cerr << "ERROR writing to socket" << std::endl;
        exit(0);
    }
    n = read(sockfd,&msgSize,sizeof(int));
    if (n < 0) 
    {
        std::cerr << "ERROR reading from socket" << std::endl;
        exit(0);
    }
    char *tempBuffer = new char[msgSize+1];
    bzero(tempBuffer,msgSize+1);
    n = read(sockfd,tempBuffer,msgSize);
    if (n < 0) 
    {
        std::cerr << "ERROR reading from socket" << std::endl;
        exit(0);
    }
    buffer = tempBuffer;
    delete [] tempBuffer;
    std::cout << "Message from server: "<< buffer << std::endl;
    close(sockfd);
    return 0;
}

This looks like a lot but it‚Äôs only because of all the conditionals, let's condense that a bit.

std::cout << "Please enter the message: ";
    std::getline(std::cin,buffer);
    int msgSize = sizeof(buffer);
    if (write(sockfd,&msgSize,sizeof(int)) < 0)  { exit(0); }
    if (write(sockfd,buffer.c_str(),msgSize) < 0)  { exit(0); }
    if (read(sockfd,&msgSize,sizeof(int)) < 0)  { exit(0); }
    char *tempBuffer = new char[msgSize+1];
    bzero(tempBuffer,msgSize+1);
    if (read(sockfd,tempBuffer,msgSize) < 0) 
    { exit(0); }
    buffer = tempBuffer;
    delete [] tempBuffer;
    std::cout << "Message from server: "<< buffer << std::endl;
    close(sockfd);
    return 0;

Much more compact and much less readable. The first two lines are grabbing input from the user, the message we will send to the server. The next 3 lines are conditionals and error handling. As I said before, we don‚Äôt need n so I opted to remove it. However, do NOT remove the ‚Äú< 0‚Äù conditional. For some inexplicable reason, C++ decides to only check if it is a negative number. I don‚Äôt know why but I removed it and it caused me errors. Anyways, write writes the message to the server, and read reads the message from the server. When we write and read to and from the server, we first need the size. This is because you can only send arrays of ints and chars using our method (you can send other data but you would have to modify the code, something outside the scope of this tutorial. I opted to send a string, and I highly recommend you do too to save yourself headaches.) and strings are actually char arrays in disguise. tempBuffer exists because the return message will not be the same size as the input so we have to make an array for it. We read the size so we can initialize the array with the right size, and read in the new message. We then delete the array to not have any memory left over, and output the message from the server. Make sure to close the socket when you‚Äôre done.

That's all you need to understand for the client template code. Let's look at the server.
Part 1.2: Understanding Sockets (server)

Now let's look at the server.

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   int sockfd, newsockfd, portno, clilen;
   struct sockaddr_in serv_addr, cli_addr;

   // Check the commandline arguments
   if (argc != 2)
   {
      std::cerr << "Port not provided" << std::endl;
      exit(0);
   }

   // Create the socket
   sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
   if (sockfd < 0)
   {
      std::cerr << "Error opening socket" << std::endl;
      exit(0);
   }

Professor Rincon has thankfully provided some comments for us to understand what‚Äôs going on. The clilen variable is short for client length. The rest is either commented for us or is explained in the client section. Before moving on, I will note that the server is created with two arguments. The first argument is ./server and the second is the port number.

   // Populate the sockaddr_in structure
   bzero((char *)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
   portno = atoi(argv[1]);
   serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
   serv_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
   serv_addr.sin_port = htons(portno);

   // Bind the socket with the sockaddr_in structure
   if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0)
   {
      std::cerr << "Error binding" << std::endl;
      exit(0);
   }

Let‚Äôs talk about binding. Binding creates the socket on the server side and populates it with the proper information so the client can connect when the socket is created on its side.

   // Set the max number of concurrent connections
   listen(sockfd, 5);
   clilen = sizeof(cli_addr);

5 is an arbitrary number, but this basically says you can have 1 active connection, and a queue of 5 connections waiting to connect after.

   // Accept a new connection
   newsockfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&cli_addr, (socklen_t *)&clilen);
   if (newsockfd < 0)
   {
      std::cerr << "Error accepting new connections" << std::endl;
      exit(0);
   }
   int n, msgSize = 0;
   n = read(newsockfd, &msgSize, sizeof(int));
   if (n < 0)
   {
      std::cerr << "Error reading from socket" << std::endl;
      exit(0);
   }
   char *tempBuffer = new char[msgSize + 1];
   bzero(tempBuffer, msgSize + 1);
   n = read(newsockfd, tempBuffer, msgSize + 1);
   if (n < 0)
   {
      std::cerr << "Error reading from socket" << std::endl;
      exit(0);
   }
   std::string buffer = tempBuffer;
   delete[] tempBuffer;
   std::cout << "Message from client: " << buffer << ", Message size: " << msgSize << std::endl;
   buffer = "I got your message";
   msgSize = buffer.size();
   n = write(newsockfd, &msgSize, sizeof(int));
   if (n < 0)
   {
      std::cerr << "Error writing to socket" << std::endl;
      exit(0);
   }
   n = write(newsockfd, buffer.c_str(), msgSize);
   if (n < 0)
   {
      std::cerr << "Error writing to socket" << std::endl;
      exit(0);
   }
   close(newsockfd);
   close(sockfd);
   return 0;

This is the receiving of the client‚Äôs message and sending the message ‚ÄúI got your message‚Äù back to the client.
Part 2: Approaching PA2

Ok, let‚Äôs look at PA1 before we look at PA2. Regardless of how you did PA1, you will have:

    A call to pthread_create(), ideally in a for loop
    A call to pthread_join(), in a separate for loop
    A void* function for the threads, which i will refer to as ThreadInstructions
    If it is not in your void* function, a function to calculate the algorithm
    A struct to pass in data to the threading function, which I will refer to as ThreadData
    A data structure to hold the values

Now, we‚Äôre going to split up the code you have and the code we have from Professor Rincon. But how? Let‚Äôs discuss this in theoretical terms, because I am not here to hold your hand through the entire process. This is a really easy assignment but it is tricky if you overthink it, which is easy to do.

So we‚Äôre going to have our threadData struct and our threadInstructions function in the client. Why? We are going to be threading EXCLUSIVELY on the client. However, the algorithm will be on the server. I‚Äôll explain how and why later, but before we do that, move your algorithm function to the server.cpp (and if it is inside your void* function take it out and make it its own function. Your void* function should now be empty, except for the casting void* to struct*, and returning nullptr. Now look at the client.cpp code, specifically lines 12 to 15, and 23 to 77. We are now going to be moving everything from lines 12 to 15 and 23 to 77 inside our void* function (if you look at Dr. Rincon‚Äôs provided client.cpp for the lines that I‚Äôm referring to. (Don‚Äôt copy over the grabbing head)

In your struct, you should add two new variables to pass in the serverIP and portno you get from argv[1] and argv[2], respectively. Since they‚Äôre always the same, you can always just pass in argv[1] and argv[2] in your struct initializer, if you have one (no worries if not, you won't be able to use one for PA3. Just set them when you initialize the struct in main()). All that‚Äôs left in your main is grabbing the input, creating and joining the threads, and outputting as usual. Nothing crazy.

Let‚Äôs go over to the server. Believe it or not, that‚Äôs all we had to do for the client. Server is what tripped me up. We‚Äôre going to be keeping everything in main, but your algorithm function should be right above your int main() and no longer a void* function if you had it in your void* function. Since we‚Äôre not threading on the server, you might be asking how we will be accepting simultaneous processes at the same time. Processes‚Ä¶ Where does that sound familiar?

That‚Äôs right, forking! We are going to be using forks on the server. But, we don‚Äôt know how many forks we need to make. Thankfully, we can take care of that using a while(true) loop just before we initialize the ‚Äúnewsockfd‚Äù variable, and begin the if(fork() == 0) conditional just after we initialize the ‚Äúnewsockfd‚Äù variable. The rest should be self explanatory.

One last thing. We need the fireman function from the fireman.cpp file from the same place we got client.cpp and server.cpp and we need to include the <sys/wait.h> library. The fireman function basically waits for our code to set itself on fire, and comes in and fixes it. (Seriously though, it will fix the issues the while(true) loop will cause when using the fork() call) Copy the function from the fireman.cpp file to the server.cpp file and remove the cout statement, leaving only the semicolon. Believe it or not, this code will still work. Crazy, right? Now we are going to call it inside our server. Just right before the while(true) loop, call signal(SIGCHLD, fireman);.

I leave the rest up to you because everyone‚Äôs code is unique, but if you did it the same way as me where you had a helper function for your algorithm and you sent a string to and from your client and server, then besides calling the appropriate functions, you should be done. See you in PA3.







COSC 3360 Operating Systems Assignment 3 (Mutex and Synchronization)
Objective:

This assignment will introduce you to interprocess synchronization mechanisms in UNIX using named POSIX semaphores, pthread mutex semaphores, and pthread condition variables.



Problem:

For this assignment, you will modify your solution for programming assignment 1 to comply with the restrictions explained below.



Your multithreaded version to determine the Shannon codes and the encoded message must execute the following steps:

 

Read the input from STDIN (the Moodle server will implement input redirection to send the information from a file to STDIN). 

Create n POSIX threads (where n is the number of lines from the input). Each child thread executes the following tasks:

Receives the original message.

Creates the alphabet based on the received input string.

Sorts the alphabet in decreasing order based on the symbols' frequency. If two or more symbols have the same frequency, you must sort them in decreasing order based on their ASCII value.

Determines the Shannon codes for the symbols in the alphabet.

Generates the encoded message by using the Shannon codes.

Prints the original message, the alphabet, and the encoded message. 



Given the following input:

COSC 3360 COSC 1437

COSC 1336 COSC 2436

COSC 3320 COSC 3380

 

The expected output is:
